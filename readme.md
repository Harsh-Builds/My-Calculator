# Simple Calculator Web Application

This is a basic calculator web app developed by **Harsh Saini** using core web technologies â€” HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to perform simple arithmetic operations in a clean, responsive, and user-friendly interface.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The calculator provides a straightforward experience with essential math operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It is entirely built from scratch, without using any external libraries or frameworks, to strengthen my foundational skills in web development.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Intuitive and responsive layout for all screen sizes
- Handles multi-step calculations correctly (e.g., `2 + 3 * 4`)
- Error handling for invalid expressions using `try...catch`
- Clean separation of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files
- Lightweight and fast â€” runs directly in the browser

## ðŸ§  What I Learned

- DOM manipulation and handling user input via JavaScript
- Applying `eval()` with safe error catching techniques
- Organizing code into reusable and maintainable structure
- Working with event listeners and dynamic rendering
- Hosting and deploying a live project using GitHub

## ðŸ’» Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox & Grid)
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6)
